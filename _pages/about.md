Fifth-year CS PhD student at the University of Southern California, working with Prof. [Jiapeng Zhang](https://sites.google.com/site/jiapeng0708/home).


My primary research interest is in design and analysis of algorithms for high-dimensional and large-scale data, 
currently focusing on genomics and image datasets. 

In my first two years if PhD, I focused particularly in unsupervised learning, approaching it from a random matrix theoretic perspective, focused on community detection 
in stochastic block model. See [research](/home//research) for more details.

In the last two years, I have focused on characterizing and exploiting structures in real-world data. 
Specifically, we have observed some very interesting density-geometry correlations in large scale genomics and image datasets that 
have shown promise in design of efficient unsupervised, self-supervised, and semi-supervised learning algorithms. 
See [On density-geometry correlations](/assets/lcpdm.html) for more details. 


## **Updates** 
We have released our new package [cplearn](https://github.com/csmukherjee/cplearn), a novel unsupervised inference tool for layer-extraction, clustering, and visualization. More updates to follow.


## **Teaching**

Besides my research, teaching is my favorite aspect of pursuing a PhD. I have had the opportunity to be a TA for various courses during my time at USC, as well as take part in K-12 outreach and REU (more details in [teaching](/home//teaching)). I look forward to teaching a full course at some point in the near future.
