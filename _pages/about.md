Rising fourth-year CS PhD student in the theory group of the University of Southern California under the advisement of Prof. [Jiapeng Zhang](https://sites.google.com/site/jiapeng0708/home).

My broad research areas are theoretical computer science and unsupervised learning, with a keen interest in random matrix theory and manifold learning. I also enjoy working on purely combinatorial problems :) 

In my three years of PhD, I explored unsupervised learning, first focusing on fundamental models of graph clustering, such as community detection in the stochastic block model (SBM), and then trying to understand the structure of real-world graphs, such as graphs obtained from biological data. See [research](/home//research) for more details. 

Currently, I am working on further characterizing real-world data and designing provable algorithms for tasks such as visualization and clustering. Additionally, I am exploring statistical-computational gaps in fundamental statistical problems (such as the planted clique problem). 


## **Teaching**

Besides my research, teaching is my favorite aspect of pursuing a PhD. I have had the opportunity to TA for various courses during my time at USC, as well as take part in K-12 outreach and REU (more details in [teaching](/home//teaching)). I look forward to teaching a full course at some point in the near future.
