## Mentoring Experience

1. Currently a **CURVE PhD mentor** for the Academic year 2023-2024, advising two students on the visualization of high-dimensional data.

   CURVE is a year-long undergraduate research program held in USC, where students actively participate in research. I will be adding more details as the semester progresses! 
   
3. **SHINE Mentor** for Summer 2022.  Advised two students on the basics of PCA when applied to biological data.

     Shine is a K-12 outreach program held in the Summers by the Viterbi School of Engineering, where high schoolers get research exposure as well as participate in some of the work.
